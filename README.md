 # *WTF is this!*
 Goldy Bot V4 is yet *another* rewrite of Goldy Bot, a discord bot that I develop for FUN. This is the third rewrite but the first rewrite to become open source, I've done this to allow developers across the world to create add-ons/extenstions for my bot that I can then add to the official production bot. 
 
 Feel free to use this module to develop your extenstions.
